In Js have DOM elments similar to in react hava react elements.

We can write React without JSX also.
but JSX makes developers life easy

JSX => JavaScript Syntax which is eassier to create react elements
JSX is different then HTML
JSX is not html in js
JSX - HTML like or XML like syntax

React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
