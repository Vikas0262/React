In Js have DOM elments similar to in react hava react elements.

We can write React without JSX also.
but JSX makes developers life easy

JSX => JavaScript Syntax which is eassier to create react elements
JSX is different then HTML
JSX is not html in js
JSX - HTML like or XML like syntax

Browser(JS) engine does not understand JSX

JS? => JavaScript is a core that js engine understand
JS engine understand ecmascript(ES6)

JSX (Transpiled(Converted) before it reaches the JS engine) - Transpiling done by Parcel - Given responsiblity to Babel(package).
bable is transpiler or compiler


React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)

JSX => React.createElement => ReactElement-JS Object => HTMLElement(render)
JSX is transpiled into React.createElement (Here is also bable is converting)

when we have to write attribute in JSX we have write in camelCase

if you write jsx in multiple line we need to wrap in bracket And in single line dont need


=== React Component ===
There are two types of Component
1 - Class Based Component (Oldest)

2 - Functional Based Component (New) => Just a Normal JS Function that return some peace of jsx code or react element

Component Composition => we used one Component inside component

{} => In curly braces we can write JavaScript
